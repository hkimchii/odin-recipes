        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Pronounced "buul-GOH-ghee", <strong>Bulgogi</strong> comes from <strong>bul ("fire")</strong> and <strong>gogi ("meat")</strong>. It originated in 
            the <strong>Goguryeo era</strong> (37 BCE - 668 CE) in Korea and stuck around because it's literally just that good.</p> 
            <p>Because beef was generally expensive back then, it was served for the wealthy noble class. So dine like kings and queens!</p>
